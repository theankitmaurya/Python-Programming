# To convert the input to number we can use int() or float() function
a = int(input("Enter number 1: ")) # this will input the number as a number not as a string

b = int(input("Enter number 2: ")) # this will input the number as a number not as a string

print("Number a is: ", a)

print("Number b is: ", b)

print("Sum is: ", a + b) # this will add the two numbers and doesn't concatenate it
